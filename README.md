# Subspace Server .NET
A zone server for the multiplayer game Subspace based on *A Small Subspace Server*.

## About
This is a cross-platform server written in C#.  It was developed based on the *A Small Subspace Server* (*ASSS*) open-source project and can be considered a derivative.  As such, the modular design closely resembles that of *ASSS* and is meant to be extended in very much the same ways. 

This project provides everything needed to host a zone. It has all of the essential functionality from *ASSS* and also many of the extras. 

- See [asss-equivalents](./doc/asss-equivalents.md) for a detailed listing and comparison of included parts.
- Also, see [additional-features](./doc/additional-features.md) for information about features that this server adds, which are not in *ASSS*.

## Get Started

[Download](https://github.com/gigamon-dev/SubspaceServer/releases) the latest release.

- Follow the [Quickstart](./doc/quickstart.md) for instructions on how to get up and running from scratch.
   - If you already have a zone running using *ASSS*, see [Quickstart from ASSS](./doc/quickstart-from-asss.md) instead. It has instructions on how to use your existing files.
- Read the [User Manual](./doc/user-manual.md) for more information.

## Build and Extend

The built-in functionality of the server is more than enough to host a zone. It's highly configurable and supports all the regular gameplay modes. However, the true power of this project is in how it can be extended by writing plugins.

For guidance on how to develop your own plugins to extend the server, see the [Developer Guide](./doc/developer-guide.md).

To build the server,
- Get the code:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gigamon-dev/SubspaceServer.git
   ````

- Open the solution: `"src/SubspaceServer.sln"` to build and run it.
- Remember to place a copy of **Continuum.exe** (currently 0.40) into the zone's **'clients'** folder: `"src/SubspaceServer/Zone/clients"` before running.
