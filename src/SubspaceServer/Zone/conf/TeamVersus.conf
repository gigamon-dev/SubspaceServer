;; Match Type Box settings
;; -----------------------
;; The section name is in the format: [<MatchType>-Box<BoxNumber>]
;; For example, for match type '2v2', the section for the first box is: [2v2-Box1]
;;
;; Each match type box must define at least one starting location (map coordinates) for each team.
;; Starting locations are in the format: Team[<Team Number>]StartLocation[N]
;; Where <Team Number> starts with 1.
;; Any # of start locations are allowed for each team. Be sure not to have a gap in the [N] as it starts reading from 1 and stops when a setting is not found or is empty.
;;
;; For example, here are starting locations for 2 teams:
;; Team1StartLocation1 = 354,354
;; Team2StartLocation1 = 459,459
;; 
;; PlayAreaMapRegion - an optional map region name that represents the play area. When set, the win condition is enabled for a team not having a member in the region. (e.g. in 2v2 when a player dies, the player respawns outside of the play area)
;;
;; Spawn position overrides can be configured with:
;; Spawn-Team#-X = <value>
;; Spawn-Team#-Y = <value>
;; Spawn-Team#-Radius = <value>
;;
;; where # is 0-3, similar to the regular arena.conf [Spawn] settings.
;;
;; These spawn positions will override any existing ones in the arena.conf [Spawn] section.
;; This can be useful if there are multiple boxes and you want players to respawn inside their box rather than a central location.
