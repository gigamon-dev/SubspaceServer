;; Match Type settings 
;; -------------------
;; The section name is the name of the Match Type.
;;
;; [<MatchType>]
;; GameTypeId - ID to use when saving stats to the database
;; Queue - Name of the queue to use
;; ArenaBaseName - The base arena name
;; MaxArenas - The maximum # of arenas
;; NumBoxes - The # of available boxes. Each box must be configured: [<MatchType>-Box<Box #>]
;; NumTeams - The # of teams.
;; PlayerPerTeam - The # of player slots per team
;; LivesPerPlayer - The # of lives each slot has per game
;; ArrivalWaitDuration - When starting a match, how long (seconds) to wait for players to arrive in the designated arena
;; ReadyWaitDuration - When starting a match, how long to wait (seconds) for players to ready up (players signal they're ready by rotating their ship or by firing a weapon)
;; StartCountdownDuration - When starting a match, how long (seconds) the starting countdown is
;; TimeLimit - The duration (TimeSpan) of a match. Empty means no time limit.
;; OverTimeLimit - The duration (TimeSpan) of overtime. Empty means no overtime.
;; WinConditionDelay - How long (TimeSpan) to wait for checking a for a win. E.g., 1 player on each team, both on their last life, wait for how long after a kill to allow for a double KO.
;; TimeLimitWinBy - When the TimeLimit of a match is hit, the amount a team's score needs to be to > the other team(s) score(s) in order to count as a win.
;; MaxLagOuts - The maximum # of times a player is allowed to lag out before they are not allowed back in and their slot is made available for others to sub in.
;; AllowShipChangeAfterDeathDuration - The amount of time (TimeSpan) that a player is allowed to change ships after a death.
;; InactiveSlotAvailableDelay - The amount of time (seconds) that an inactive slot (player changed to spec or left the arena) becomes available for others to sub in.

;; Match Type Box settings
;; -----------------------
;; The section name is in the format: [<MatchType>-Box<BoxNumber>]
;; For example, for match type '2v2', the section for the first box is: [2v2-Box1]
;;
;; Each match type box must define at least one starting location (map coordinates) for each team.
;; Starting locations are in the format: Team[<Team Number>]StartLocation[N]
;; Where <Team Number> starts with 1.
;; Any # of start locations are allowed for each team. Be sure not to have a gap in the [N] as it starts reading from 1 and stops when a setting is not found or is empty.
;;
;; For example, here are starting locations for 2 teams:
;; Team1StartLocation1 = 354,354
;; Team2StartLocation1 = 459,459
;; 
;; PlayAreaMapRegion - an optional map region name that represents the play area. When set, the win condition is enabled for a team not having a member in the region. (e.g. in 2v2 when a player dies, the player respawns outside of the play area)
;;
;; Spawn position overrides can be configured with:
;; Spawn-Team#-X = <value>
;; Spawn-Team#-Y = <value>
;; Spawn-Team#-Radius = <value>
;;
;; where # is 0-3, similar to the regular arena.conf [Spawn] settings.
;;
;; These spawn positions will override any existing ones in the arena.conf [Spawn] section.
;; This can be useful if there are multiple boxes and you want players to respawn inside their box rather than a central location.
